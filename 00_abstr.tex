Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing technique that automatically identifies sentiments within text, allowing businesses to understand their customers' emotions in social media, customer reviews, surveys, and more. In this project, we try to build the automatic sentiment analyzer system based on SVM and Multinomial Naive Bayes. The frequency of occurrence of words is used as features for the SVM. To train our system we are gonna use the SemEval-201 dataset which containing tweets that are manually annotated for the sentiment (positive and negative). \\
